Experimental Javascript RTS in the HTML5 CANVAS

Very early iteration. 

Mouse Controls:

Left click: select unit or building.

Right click: select action target.


The only right-click actions are on the grunts. They are move to spot if you clicked grass. If you clicked woods, it will go and harvest wood. 


--Changelog--
0.0: -Need to attach pathfinding to movement and bar from moving into woods. 
	 bug: with a grunt selected, right-clicking on an inside tree will take the path finder forever to see there is no path.
